name: Trope Detection Dispute
about: Dispute a specific trope detection on a character analysis
title: "[DISPUTE] "
labels: trope-dispute
assignees: ''
---

## Character + Media

<!-- Example: Akira, John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) -->

## Trope ID Disputed

<!-- Example: KRAV_MAGA_DEFAULT or the trope name from the analysis -->

## Dispute Reason

<!-- Choose one or more:
- False positive: the trope was detected but genuinely doesn't apply
- Missed subversion: the character clearly deconstructs this trope and the analysis missed it
- Wrong severity: the severity is inconsistent with how the taxonomy defines it
-->

## Evidence (minimum 50 characters)

<!-- Specific scenes, dialogue, narrative beats, or academic citations that support your dispute. "I like this character" is not evidence. -->

## What the Correct Classification Should Be

<!-- Either: trope doesn't apply / trope applies but at lower severity / trope applies but is subverted -->
