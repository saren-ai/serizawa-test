# Contributing to the Serizawa Test

Thank you for contributing. The Serizawa Test improves through community input — particularly from Japanese-American community members, media scholars, and fans who have direct experience with the representations we study.

All contributions are subject to review and are not automatically accepted. The goal is accuracy, not volume.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Submit a New Trope

The trope taxonomy currently has 34 entries. New tropes must meet the bar for inclusion:

- Specifically and repeatedly documented in Western-produced media featuring Japanese or Nikkei characters
- Meaningfully distinct from existing taxonomy entries (not a sub-variant)
- Demonstrably harmful or limiting to Japanese character representation
- Attributable to a named pattern (TVTropes entry, academic citation, or ≥3 documented examples)

**Via the app:** Transparency page → Submit New Trope  
**Via GitHub:** Open an Issue using the [New Trope Submission](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-trope.md) template

Required fields:
- Proposed trope name
- Category (Archetype / Cultural Reduction / Sexualization / Appearance+Accent+Language / Role Limitation / Identity+Casting+Systemic)
- Description (what the pattern is and why it's harmful or limiting)
- Severity (minor −0.05 / moderate −0.10 / major −0.25)
- Tonal register (🚨 Trigger Warning / 📚 Teachable Moment / 😂 Ruthless Mockery)
- At least one documented example with media title, year, and character name
- TVTropes slug or academic citation if available

New trope submissions require ≥3 community support votes before entering admin review.

### 2. Dispute a Trope Detection

If the app has misclassified a trope detection for a specific character, you can dispute it.

**Valid dispute reasons:**
- False positive: the trope was detected but doesn't apply to this portrayal
- Missed context: the detection ignores a clear subversion or narrative deconstruction
- Wrong severity: the assigned severity is inconsistent with the taxonomy definition

**Not valid:**
- "I like this character / this movie" — personal preference is not a dispute
- Disagreement with the trope taxonomy itself — that's a separate process (see §4)

**Via the app:** Character detail page → Trope pill → Dispute button  
**Via GitHub:** Open an Issue using the [Trope Dispute](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/trope-dispute.md) template

Required fields: Character name + media, trope ID, dispute reason (min 50 chars), evidence.

Disputes resolved in your favor count toward Critic eligibility (see §5).

### 3. Propose a Rule Change

The Serizawa Five (Q1–Q4) and the Q5 flag can be modified if there is a compelling evidence-based case.

Rule changes are treated seriously — they affect every existing and future analysis score. The bar is high.

**Required:**
- Specific rule ID (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, or Q5) and sub-criterion if applicable
- Proposed change (be precise — if wording, quote the existing wording and your replacement)
- Rationale minimum 50 characters — vague suggestions are not reviewed
- At least one evidence link (academic paper, documented example, existing test framework comparison)

**Via the app:** Transparency page → Suggest Rule Change  
**Via GitHub:** Open an Issue using the [Rule Change Proposal](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rule-change.md) template

Rule changes that are accepted are logged in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with a rubric version increment.

---

### 4. Add a Glossary Term

The glossary covers representation concepts, trope names, Japanese cultural terms used in analyses, and other test framework names.

**Via the app:** Glossary page → Submit Term  
**Via GitHub:** Open an Issue with the [Glossary Term](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/glossary-term.md) template

Required: term, definition, source or citation if available.

---

### 5. Critic Status

Critic votes carry **3× weight** in the community scoring layer. Critic status is earned, not self-assigned.

You qualify for Critic status if you meet **any one** of:
- 3+ accepted trope submissions to the taxonomy
- 5+ trope disputes resolved in your favor
- Admin invitation (for researchers, journalists, recognized community figures)

Apply via the app: Profile → Apply for Critic Status. Criteria are evaluated by admins.

---

### 6. Editorial Contributions (Wiki)

The GitHub wiki contains manually authored pages for Wall of Shame entries, Hall of Fame entries, and Era Guides. These are more substantial pieces — 300–1000 words with specific citations.

If you'd like to contribute an essay for a Wall of Shame or Hall of Fame character, open a GitHub Issue tagged `wiki-essay` with the character name and a brief pitch. We'll assign it if the character qualifies and no essay is in progress.

---

## What We Don't Accept

- Submissions defending yellowface, ethnic caricature, or harmful tropes as "products of their time" without critical engagement
- Personal attacks on actors, directors, or community members
- Proposals to remove characters from the Wall of Shame based on nostalgia
- Trope submissions targeting non-Japanese Asian representation (this framework is specifically Japanese / Nikkei — cross-ethnicity adaptation is a future roadmap item)

---

## Code of Conduct

This project exists to serve Japanese-American community members and scholars who have direct experience with the representations we analyze. Contributions must reflect that purpose.

Treat disagreements about representation with the seriousness they deserve. These aren't abstract debates — they're about how real people see themselves reflected (or erased) in media.

## Attribution

All accepted contributions are attributed in the app and wiki. Trope submissions credit the submitter by display name. Wiki essays credit the author.
